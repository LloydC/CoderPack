<h1> <u>Scientists Create Transparent Solar Concentrator</u> </h1>	
<img src="images/transparent solar concentrator.jpg" alt="solar_concentrator" height= "300" width = "300"/>
<p>Solar concentrators are used to lens sunlight, focusing it on a small area to maximize the amount of light, maximizing the amount of electricity generated. This is similar to using a magnifying glass to set leaves on fire. These can be quite large and a bit of an eyesore, as they are very much function over form. While many people have been attempting to create a see-through lens for years, the balance between efficiency and transparency has been hard to come by, with most prior attempts resulting in a colored product.

<h3>What Are GMOs?</h3>

<p>Humans have been modifying the genomes of plants and animals for our benefit for thousands of years using a process known as artificial selection, or selective breeding. This involves selecting organisms with desirable traits and breeding them so that certain characteristics are perpetuated. This could be a teacup dog, a cow with improved milk production or a fruit without seeds. However, this is limited to naturally occurring variations, which is where genetic engineering has found a place.
