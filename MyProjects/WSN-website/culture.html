<h1> Iranian Becomes First Woman To Ever Win The "Nobel Prize" Of Mathematics </h1>
<img src="images/maryam.jpg" alt="Nobel_winner" height= "300" width = "400"/>

<p> The International Mathematical Union established an award to honor excellence in mathematicians under the age of 40. The award was named after Canadian mathematician John C. Fields, and has often been described as the "Nobel Prize of mathematics."" The Fields Medal has been awarded every four years since 1936. Up to four outstanding mathematicians can be honored at once, but 2014 is the first time a woman has been honored with the prize. Maryam Mirzakhani is a professor at Stanford University who was recognized for "her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces."</p>

<p>Born in Tehran, Iran, Mirzakhani's excellence in math extends back to when she was in high school. She earned gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad the world's most distinguished math tournament for pre-collegiate students not once, but twice. Her showing in 1995 resulted in a perfect score for her; a most impressive accomplishment.</p>

<p>"It is fun, it's like solving a puzzle or connecting the dots in a detective case," she explained to the Stanford Report. "I felt that this was something I could do and I wanted to pursue this path."</p>

<p>She completed her undergraduate degree at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran and earned her PhD at Harvard University while studying under Curtis McMullen, who was awarded the Fields Medal himself back in 1998.</p>

<p> Mirzakhani is being honored for her work with finding the volume of moduli spaces in complex one-dimensional planes known as Riemann surfaces. However, she is quite talented in many areas mathematics, with research interests in "Teichmuller theory, Hyperbolic geometry, Ergodic theory and Symplectic geometry."<p>
