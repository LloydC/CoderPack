<p> German champions Bayern Munich have won the race to sign highly-rated defender Mehdi Benatia from Roma. </p>

<p> The 27-year-old Morocco international had reportedly been a target for Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City earlier in the transfer window, but has now agreed on a move to Munich after excelling at the Stadio Olimpico to help Roma finish second in Serie A last season. </p>

<p> The Bundesliga giants Bayern have now secured his services for the next five years. </p>

<p> A statement published on the clubâ€™s official website read: "On Tuesday afternoon the German champions reached an agreement with Roma over the transfer of Mehdi Benatia. Both clubs have agreed not to disclose the transfer fee."</p>

<p> "Benatia will come to Munich in the next few days to undergo a medical. The central defender will then sign a five-year contract."</p>
