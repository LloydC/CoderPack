	<h4>Rudy Kurniawan, 37, was convicted in December and will now be sentenced on 4 August. He was accused of fooling buyers into thinking wine made in his kitchen in Arcadia was rare. Arrested in 2012, the Indonesian-born vintner was accused of selling at least $20m (Â£11.8m) in counterfeit bottles. "[He] liked the feeling of being the centre of attention. It gave him a feeling of achievement and belonging that he had never before experienced," defence lawyer Jerome Mooney said of his client's previously elevated role in the prestigious wine community.</h4>
