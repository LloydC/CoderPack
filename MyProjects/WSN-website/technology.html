<h1> Facebook and Twitter users 'more likely' to censor their views offline </h1>

<p>Americans have been self-censoring their discussions about state surveillance in the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013, researchers have found.</p>

<p>Approximately 86% of adults were "very" or "somewhat" willing to discuss the findings in person with family, friends or work colleagues or at public meetings, yet only 43% said they would discuss the issues on Facebook.</p>

<p> The Pew Research Centre surveyed 1,801 US adults in August and September 2013, and also found that only 41% of people would be willing to discuss surveillance on Twitter which is a more visible, public medium than Facebook. </p>

<h1>Blue Mo-Fi headphones review: powered-up hi-fi headphones </h1>

<img src="images/Headphones.jpeg" alt="snowden" height= "300" width = "300"/>

<p>The microphone manufacturer Blue has made its first foray into the headphone market, revealing a powerful, premium set of headphones that aim to compete with Beats and Bose.</p>

<p>Blue's Mo-Fi includes a built-in "audiophile" amplifier, which boosts the power of the often weak audio from mobile devices. That allows Blue to pack larger, more power hungry speakers with better sound into the earcups. The power and quality of a hi-fi system in a headphone; at least that's the premise.</p>

<p>Blue said it went back to the drawing board on the design of the Mo-Fi headphones. They certainly don't look like other headphones, with a main rectangular block that sits on the head supporting two articulating arms that hold the ear cups in place.</p>

<p>The ear cups are held completely parallel on the side of the head, with even pressure around the whole ear no matter what size the head. Most headphone bands either pinch at the top or bottom of the ear. </p>
