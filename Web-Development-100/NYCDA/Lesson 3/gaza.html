	<h4>Israel says it has resumed bombardment of Gaza, after earlier accepting a truce proposal, as Hamas militants continued firing rockets.
	 Gaza officials said three children were killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza City. Israel said dozens of rockets had been fired by militants.The five-hour truce had been called to help Gazans stock up on supplies.
	Both Israel and Hamas, which controls Gaza, denied earlier reports a longer-term truce had been agreed but talks are continuing in Egypt.
	French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius is to travel to Egypt and Israel on Friday to try to help with the negotiations, President Francois Hollande said.</h4>
